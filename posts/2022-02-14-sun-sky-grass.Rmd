> Introduction: A quick look at the sun, the sky and grass.

### Sun and Sky Plot

This example demonstrates a simple illustration of the sun and sky using base R plotting.

```{r}
# Set up plot
plot(
  1, 1, 
  xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0, 10), 
  type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", 
  xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", bty = "n"
)

# Draw the sky
rect(0, 0, 10, 10, col = "skyblue", border = NA)

# Draw the sun
symbols(7, 7, circles = 1.5, inches = FALSE, add = TRUE, bg = "yellow")

# Draw grass
rect(0, 0, 10, 3, col = "green3", border = NA)
```
