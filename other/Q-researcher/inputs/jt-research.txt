core_topics:
  - Language models as simulators of human cognition, beliefs, and behavior
  - Semantic modeling of sensory language, especially olfaction
  - Procedural and survey language as structured reasoning environments for LLMs
  - Human-aligned modeling of perception, reasoning, and representation
  - Agent-based document workflows for deep research and ideation
  - LLMs as meta-theorists: generating, evaluating, and simulating behavioral and cognitive models


subthemes:
  - LLMs for survey emulation, policy sentiment synthesis, and virtual demographics
  - Zero-shot generalization in behavioral, perceptual, or procedural tasks
  - Grounding sensory descriptors (especially olfaction) using language and perceptual embeddings
  - Procedural texts (e.g., recipes, scientific methods) as a substrate for evaluating model reasoning
  - Cognitive science as benchmark: tasks like bandits, memory, and inference for probing alignment
  - Simulation of social and perceptual judgments via prompted personas or demographics
