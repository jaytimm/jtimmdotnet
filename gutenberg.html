            <li><strong>I never imagined you, Henri, so obdurate, so entirely without repentance, regretting merely your own ruined life and shattered career.</strong> | Couperus, Louis</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined you'd both swallow it whole.</strong> | Brazil, Angela</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined, that he who, in the mirth of a nocturnal revel, concurred in ridiculing his friend, would consider, in a cooler hour, that the same trick might be played against himself; or that even where there is no sense of danger, the natural pride of human nature rises against him, who, by general censures, lays claim to general superiority.</strong> | Johnson, Samuel</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined that."</strong> | Wallace, Edgar</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined that you cared at all--really, I mean, as I know now.</strong> | Mason, A. E. W.</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined that instrument could produce such pretty music!"</strong> | Sherman, Harold M.</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined the power of the wind was so great."</strong> | Cooper, James A.</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined that a human being could so continuously labour and so collectedly think as did Tim through that Hell's half hour when the flurry was at its worst.</strong> | Kipling, Rudyard</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined you thought I was that sort of a social mercenary.</strong> | Chambers, Robert W.</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined then that I'd ever see you again, much less find you away out here on the desert."</strong> | Johnston, Annie F.</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined for a moment....</strong> | McFee, William</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined you'd been there, and I never imagined you could be anything but serious, either.</strong> | Davis, Richard Harding</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined anyone would venture; and now I beg you will resume your meal."</strong> | Fenn, George Manville</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined he was capable of such silly impertinence.” He then turned towards his son, and said severely:—</strong> | Ségur, Sophie, comtesse de</li>
            <li><strong>I never imagined it had amounted to that.”</strong> | Burney, Fanny</li>
