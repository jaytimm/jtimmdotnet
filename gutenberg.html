            <li><strong>They should remember</strong> that “Mac” and “O” indicate a longer and nobler pedigree than either Capet, Plantagenet, Tudor, Stuart, Guelph, or Wettin—all distinguished enough in their way, but quite modern when compared with the Gaelic patronymics. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/67845/67845-h/67845-h.htm#:~:text=They%20should%20remember%20that%20%E2%80%9CMac%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CO%E2%80%9D%20indicate%20a%20longer%20and%20nobler%20pedigree%20than%20either%20Capet%2C%20Plantagenet%2C%20Tudor%2C%20Stuart%2C%20Guelph%2C%20or%20Wettin%E2%80%94all%20distinguished%20enough%20in%20their%20way%2C%20but%20quite%20modern%20when%20compared%20with%20the%20Gaelic%20patronymics." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Finerty, John F.</em></li>
            <li><strong>They should remember</strong> also that whenever they take such a well-known drug as ergot for the control of bleeding, or make use of many other apparently simple measures, they are unconsciously rendering tribute to this type of investigation. | <em>Slemons, J.
