          <ul>
            <li><strong>She hoped that he had freed himself at last from evil associates.</strong> | Dixon, Thomas, Jr.</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that her polite little partner would quickly return to take her back to the ballroom, in which the music had again begun.</strong> | Weigall, Arthur E. P. Brome</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that we should come across the man in charge of her trunk, and that we should have no difficulty in getting it back.</strong> | Casanova, Giacomo</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that an angel would call out of heaven to her relief.</strong> | Eggleston, Edward</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that he had not yet returned, and ran down the stairs quickly, so that she might go out unperceived.</strong> | Orczy, Emmuska Orczy, Baroness</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that Thea would take her at her word.</strong> | Miller, Alex. McVeigh, Mrs.</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that he might have been sent home, and who can blame her?</strong> | Alexander, Archibald</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that this nice old lady would say something about the virtues of the medicine, for it cured two more people, even while she looked, and if she could be sure it did all that was claimed for it she would spend all the rest of her birthday money in buying a bottle for Tippy.</strong> | Johnston, Annie F.</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that he would continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise de Villeparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with strings.</strong> | Proust, Marcel</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that Newman would never be afraid of her, however he might be with the others, for, really, she went very far indeed.</strong> | James, Henry</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that, when the birds came back, they would not find her, for she was too much grieved to talk, or even listen to music.</strong> | Guild, C. S.</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that he would not make use of his power; yet all the while she vaguely desired it.</strong> | Tolstoy, Leo, graf</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that the music she must hear there would rest her soul, and perhaps she might be able to pray.</strong> | Maugham, W. Somerset</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that she might not see him--she had never spoken to him, she remembered, since the day when he had asked her to be his friend.</strong> | Sergeant, Adeline</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that time would improve him; and besides, she did not yet know the full extent of his imperfections, as he had, of course, been anxious to show her only the fairer side of his character.</strong> | Bell, Henry Glassford</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that he and paw and Sally Dows were happy!</strong> | Harte, Bret</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that within a month at the latest it would be safe to hint to Gregory that such supremacy existed.</strong> | Phillpotts, Eden</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that Leonard would think over what she had said and act upon it, although he had not given the promise that she asked.</strong> | Leslie, Emma</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that he would go away at once; but he went into Marya Dmitrievna’s room and remained nearly an hour with her.</strong> | Turgenev, Ivan Sergeevich</li>
            <li><strong>She hoped that she had answered rightly--that he had suspected nothing.</strong> | Pain, Barry</li>
