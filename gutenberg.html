            <li><strong>We must remember</strong>, however, that the apparent freedom of the classical languages is due in great measure to the artificial style of literary men who took advantage of the inflectional character of the dialects they spoke to invert the position of words for rhetorical purposes, and that such inversions were not usual in the language of everyday life. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/73585/73585-h/73585-h.htm#:~:text=We%20must%20remember%2C%20however%2C%20that%20the%20apparent%20freedom%20of%20the%20classical%20languages%20is%20due%20in%20great%20measure%20to%20the%20artificial%20style%20of%20literary%20men%20who%20took%20advantage%20of%20the%20inflectional%20character%20of%20the%20dialects%20they%20spoke%20to%20invert%20the%20position%20of%20words%20for%20rhetorical%20purposes%2C%20and%20that%20such%20inversions%20were%20not%20usual%20in%20the%20language%20of%20everyday%20life." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Sayce, A.

            <li><strong>We must remember</strong> that dissatisfaction at existing evil (the feeling of all young and ardent minds), the struggle to escape from the "circumstance" of the evil world, has a carnal counterfeit--the love of novelty, and self-will, and self-conceit, which may thrust us down into the abysses of misrule and uncertainty; as it has done such men as Shelley and Byron; trying vainly every loophole, beating against the prison bars of an imperfect system; neither degraded enough to make themselves a fool's paradise within it, nor wise enough to escape from it through Christ, "the door into the sheepfold," to return when they will, and bring others with them into the serene empyrean of spiritual truth--truth which explains, and arranges, and hallows, and subdues everything. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20711/20711-h/20711-h.htm#:~:text=We%20must%20remember%20that%20dissatisfaction%20at%20existing%20evil%20%28the%20feeling%20of%20all%20young%20and%20ardent%20minds%29%2C%20the%20struggle%20to%20escape%20from%20the%20%22circumstance%22%20of%20the%20evil%20world%2C%20has%20a%20carnal%20counterfeit--the%20love%20of%20novelty%2C%20and%20self-will%2C%20and%20self-conceit%2C%20which%20may%20thrust%20us%20down%20into%20the%20abysses%20of%20misrule%20and%20uncertainty%3B%20as%20it%20has%20done%20such%20men%20as%20Shelley%20and%20Byron%3B%20trying%20vainly%20every%20loophole%2C%20beating%20against%20the%20prison%20bars%20of%20an%20imperfect%20system%3B%20neither%20degraded%20enough%20to%20make%20themselves%20a%20fool%27s%20paradise%20within%20it%2C%20nor%20wise%20enough%20to%20escape%20from%20it%20through%20Christ%2C%20%22the%20door%20into%20the%20sheepfold%2C%22%20to%20return%20when%20they%20will%2C%20and%20bring%20others%20with%20them%20into%20the%20serene%20empyrean%20of%20spiritual%20truth--truth%20which%20explains%2C%20and%20arranges%2C%20and%20hallows%2C%20and%20subdues%20everything." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Kingsley, Charles</em></li>
