          <ul>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> find them in reality!</strong> | Walton, Bryce</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> wash his hands of the orphan altogether; and accordingly, without consulting the boy’s wishes, indentured him in January, 1772, to a cobbler, a cousin of his in Exeter, with whom he would be bound to remain till he was twenty-one.</strong> | Baring-Gould, S.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> meet death unflinchingly.</strong> | Gaboriau, Emile</li>

            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> keep up their noble game of friendship as long as might be.</strong> | Bellamy, Edward</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> associate his name indelibly with the field of Ypres; <strong>he was determined to</strong> win the highest possible decoration on July 31: he knew what the risks were; he had seen enough of war to know what a modern push meant; he had not come through Guillemont and Ginchy for nothing and learnt nothing; <strong>he was determined to</strong> stake life and limbs and everything on the attainment of his ambition.</strong> | Floyd, Thomas Hope</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> lose nothing by Jean Jacques, and he was prepared to take instant action when it was required; but he was also interested in the man who might have done really powerful things in the world, had he gone about them in the right way.</strong> | Parker, Gilbert</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> let the widow perceive that he had made his choice, and that he could not be bought with her money.</strong> | Barr, Amelia E.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> find a solid foundation for both morality and law, and to raise upon it an edifice, no stone of which should be laid except in accordance with the deductions of the severest logic.</strong> | Various</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> make a lawyer of him, and sent him to school with that end in view.</strong> | Thayer, William Makepeace</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> protect his own name, come what might--a fact which, because of her own acquiescence up to this time, still carried great weight with her.</strong> | Dreiser, Theodore</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> cover himself with glory; <strong>he was determined to</strong> let people see that he did not know what fear was.</strong> | Floyd, Thomas Hope</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> be rid of her, and as quickly as possible, in order that he might satisfy his new passion, and all the Archbishops in Christendom would not have stopped him.</strong> | Gower, Ronald Sutherland, Lord</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> secure the condemnation of _Boniface VIII_., even after his death.</strong> | Fisher, George Park</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> be civil head of Nauvoo from the first, soon of the county also, erelong of the State, and eventually of the nation.</strong> | Beers, R. W.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> save the girl, because he understood dimly that she belonged in some way to Esca, and the loyal old swordsman would not have hesitated one moment in flinging his life down, then and there, to purchase her safety.</strong> | Whyte-Melville, G. J.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> make the surprise as complete as possible.</strong> | Eggleston, George Cary</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> sleep in a house that night, and, moreover, he had a great curiosity to see what trolls looked like.</strong> | Pyle, Katharine</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> force his idea of the Heroic in Art on a public that had got beyond gods and goddesses and the heroes of the Greeks and Romans.</strong> | Baring-Gould, S.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> make a lady of her, which necessitated her being sent to school; she preferred hemming, baking and rubbing things till they shone, and not both could have had their way (which sounds fatal for the man), had they not arranged a compromise, Grizel, for instance, to study geography for an hour in the evening with Miss Langlands (go to school in the daytime she would not) so long as the doctor shaved every morning, but if no shave no geography; the doctor to wipe his pen on the blot-sheet instead of on the lining of his coat if she took three lessons a week from Miss Oram on the spinet.</strong> | Barrie, J. M.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> reduce the place preparatively to more important operations.</strong> | Motley, John Lothrop</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> follow her home to that squalid and horrible flat, and insist upon the earliest possible wedding.</strong> | Holding, Elisabeth Sanxay</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> extort money from the Venetian Republic; he also needed a pretext for occupying Verona, and for any future wrongs.</strong> | Fyffe, Charles Alan</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> enforce his legal rights by legal measures.</strong> | Newcomb, Simon</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He was determined to</strong> use his power to the utmost, unless he was paid to be still; and Hastings consented to pay him.</strong> | Macaulay, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron</li>
