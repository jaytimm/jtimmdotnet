          <ul>
            <li><strong>We never knew who would be next to go, and we could only continue to plug along as best we could with our flying and study a little harder on our ground-school work while we waited for the almost weekly list of washouts to be published on our bulletin board.</strong> | Lindbergh, Charles A.</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew the real taste of war--at least, I didn't--until the South African tragedy: and now everybody seems to think there'll be a great European War before very long, with us in the thick of it, and the German Emperor trying to be William the Conqueror the Second.</strong> | Fowler, Ellen Thorneycroft</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew quite what happened.</strong> | United States. Work Projects Administration</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew positively the cause of the enemy’s hesitation in making an attempt to attack us, but we heard that one or two flags of truce had been sent from our Government at Calcutta up the Irrawaddy with dispatches to Ava for the Burmese Government, and we concluded that terms of amity and peace had been proposed and perhaps agreed to, and this became the more probable when, early in March, 1842, orders were received for the immediate return of the 50th Regiment to Calcutta.</strong> | Anderson, Joseph Jocelyn</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew how the first one managed to get into the place nor where he went when he got out of it.</strong> | Hanshew, Thomas W.</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew why the brass buttons were so precious.</strong> | Robins, Elizabeth</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew her to say: these card-playing, fox-hunting people are our inferiors.</strong> | Robins, Elizabeth</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew whether he heard us rustling about among the plants, but it is highly probable that he did.</strong> | Hall, Florence Howe</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew him.</strong> | Ouida</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew before that Lingo and Cowslip were descendants of Touchstone and Audrey.</strong> | Hazlitt, William</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew a child so quiet and free from pain; as much so as any offspring of the brute creation, which are free from it merely by following nature or instinct, which never errs.</strong> | Mauriceau, A. M.</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew--I believe no one except his son ever fully knew--the history of his death-bed.</strong> | Craik, Dinah Maria Mulock</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew one from any manufactory, paper-made, that could hold together; yet we go on with the conceit that we have consummate skill in that line; we make ourselves, as it were, sole patentees for all people and nations, and wonder at the folly of those who reject the commodity, and yet we never attempt the thing on a small scale at home, or a large one abroad, but the result is a failure.</strong> | Various</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew his antecedents--never knew where behind the sky-line he had been concealed all those years before that morning when he appeared, pale and unannounced, at the well.</strong> | Paine, Albert Bigelow</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew each other till about ten days ago, but we are great chums now.” And he slipped an arm affectionately round his little sister.</strong> | Rhoades, Nina</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew whether Nellie discovered the truth or not.</strong> | Bell, Lilian</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew, for sure, whether our troops or those of the enemy held any certain crater, except the ones on each end, numbers one and six (we held them throughout the entire two months of fighting), but numbers two, three, four and five were debatable ground for several weeks.</strong> | McBride, Herbert W.</li>
            <li><strong>We never knew the cause of his death.</strong> | Williams, Elizabeth Whitney</li>
