          <p>He always thought too highly of himself while neglecting the impact of his actions on others.</p>

            <li><strong>He always thought as he was God Almighty, did your poor father, my dear, and he never gave a back glance, as ’twere, to the tens and hundreds and thousands as he’d ruined.”</strong> | Ouida</li>
            <li><strong>He always thought of her when matrimony was suggested to him, but he had no suspicion that his companion was drifting that way.</strong> | Holmes, Mary Jane</li>
            <li><strong>He always thought it odd when Marianne called him uncle, just like that:</strong> | Couperus, Louis</li>
            <li><strong>He always thought it better for ministers to pray oftener, and divide their prayers, than to be long and tedious—except on special occasions, such as days of humiliation and the like; because he believed that heart and spirit, especially in the weak, could with difficulty continue so long to stand bent, as it were, towards God,—as is meet in prayer,—without flagging and failing.</strong> | Bradford, William</li>
            <li><strong>He always thought, and now he was sure, he would get even with that uncle of mine, whose pride he was going to take down; and I was borne away through another deluge of the captain’s oaths.</strong> | Keeler, Ralph</li>
            <li><strong>He always thought of me as dead--and I had every reason to suppose that he too was no more; but a strange meeting was in store for us, one which made Toby’s heart all the lighter.</strong> | Melville, Herman</li>
            <li><strong>He always thought me of no consequence whatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was tolerable.</strong> | Dostoyevsky, Fyodor</li>
            <li><strong>He always thought much for others; and now there was the misery of perhaps unsettling others--others who had trusted him with their very souls--others, to whom it was impossible to explain the conflicts which were passing in his own mind.</strong> | Church, R. W.</li>
            <li><strong>He always thought for himself and never accepted as gold the counters that pass for ideas.</strong> | Gore Browne, Robert</li>
