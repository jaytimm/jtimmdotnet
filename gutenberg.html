          <ul>
            <li><strong>She thought about it until she persuaded herself that she had been deeply wronged.</strong> | Ouida</li>
            <li><strong>She thought about it for a long time.</strong> | Brown, Abbie Farwell</li>
            <li><strong>She thought about him the very first moment on waking; and his was the very last name mentioned in her prayers.</strong> | Thackeray, William Makepeace</li>
            <li><strong>She thought about "him" with great sadness and perhaps longing--about his honest, stupid, constant kindness and fidelity; his never-ceasing obedience; his good humour; his bravery and courage.</strong> | Thackeray, William Makepeace</li>
            <li><strong>She thought about the man in the room down the hall with the lines of dissipation on his face.</strong> | Rinehart, Mary Roberts</li>
            <li><strong>She thought about him as she munched her supper, and wondered what he was really like.</strong> | Swinnerton, Frank</li>
            <li><strong>She thought about her father again, and wished that he was in Chicago.</strong> | Micheaux, Oscar</li>
            <li><strong>She thought about cutting off an end of one of the blankets, but rather hated to do that; so she worked away with her hook and the banana fiber till she had evolved what satisfied him.</strong> | Kneeland, Clarissa A.</li>
            <li><strong>She thought about him, too; she usually did--about his niceness to her, his never-to-be-forgotten kindness; her own gratitude to him for her never-to-be-forgotten initiation.</strong> | Chambers, Robert W.</li>
            <li><strong>She thought about that.</strong> | Wylie, Philip</li>
            <li><strong>She thought about that a moment, scrunching up her face, then declared "No!"</strong> | Hoover, Thomas</li>
