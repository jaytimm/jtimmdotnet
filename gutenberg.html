            <li><strong>They must look</strong> into the personal life of the writer; they must discover and estimate all the influences by which he was surrounded; and among these they give a very important place to the condition of the society in which he lived, the political and religious forces which were at work while he was studying, thinking, writing. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/32616/32616-h/32616-h.htm#:~:text=They%20must%20look%20into%20the%20personal%20life%20of%20the%20writer%3B%20they%20must%20discover%20and%20estimate%20all%20the%20influences%20by%20which%20he%20was%20surrounded%3B%20and%20among%20these%20they%20give%20a%20very%20important%20place%20to%20the%20condition%20of%20the%20society%20in%20which%20he%20lived%2C%20the%20political%20and%20religious%20forces%20which%20were%20at%20work%20while%20he%20was%20studying%2C%20thinking%2C%20writing." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Various</em></li>
