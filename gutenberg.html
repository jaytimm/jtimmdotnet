            <li><strong>We can leave</strong> all in His hands--and if we are wise we shall do so--to whom _great_ and _small_ are terms that have no meaning; and who looks upon men's lives, not according to the apparent magnitude of the deeds with which they are filled, but simply according to the motive from which, and the purpose towards which, these deeds were done. | <em>Maclaren, Alexander</em></li>
            <li><strong>We can leave</strong> Spinoza out of the question, and even allow him to remain in the eyes of his critics an utter atheist and materialist; for the cautious reserve which he placed upon himself in his writings makes it extremely difficult for one who does not read him between the lines, and is not thoroughly acquainted with the hidden meaning of the Pythagorean metaphysics, to ascertain what his real sentiments were. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/68705/68705-h/68705-h.htm#:~:text=We%20can%20leave%20Spinoza%20out%20of%20the%20question%2C%20and%20even%20allow%20him%20to%20remain%20in%20the%20eyes%20of%20his%20critics%20an%20utter%20atheist%20and%20materialist%3B%20for%20the%20cautious%20reserve%20which%20he%20placed%20upon%20himself%20in%20his%20writings%20makes%20it%20extremely%20difficult%20for%20one%20who%20does%20not%20read%20him%20between%20the%20lines%2C%20and%20is%20not%20thoroughly%20acquainted%20with%20the%20hidden%20meaning%20of%20the%20Pythagorean%20metaphysics%2C%20to%20ascertain%20what%20his%20real%20sentiments%20were." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Blavatsky, H.
