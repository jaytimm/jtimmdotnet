            <li><strong>We should see</strong> in this, not so much one of the forms assumed by the cringing slavishness born of centuries of subjection, not so much an example of Oriental cunning, as of the polish of Eastern manners. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/41755/41755-h/41755-h.htm#:~:text=We%20should%20see%20in%20this%2C%20not%20so%20much%20one%20of%20the%20forms%20assumed%20by%20the%20cringing%20slavishness%20born%20of%20centuries%20of%20subjection%2C%20not%20so%20much%20an%20example%20of%20Oriental%20cunning%2C%20as%20of%20the%20polish%20of%20Eastern%20manners." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Dilke, Charles Wentworth, Sir</em></li>
            <li><strong>We should see</strong> also an orange-coloured flower, for there would be a faint red image of it, and a faint yellow image of it, one on each film, lying one over the other, producing the same effect as a mixture of yellow and red pigments. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38045/38045-h/38045-h.htm#:~:text=We%20should%20see%20also%20an%20orange-coloured%20flower%2C%20for%20there%20would%20be%20a%20faint%20red%20image%20of%20it%2C%20and%20a%20faint%20yellow%20image%20of%20it%2C%20one%20on%20each%20film%2C%20lying%20one%20over%20the%20other%2C%20producing%20the%20same%20effect%20as%20a%20mixture%20of%20yellow%20and%20red%20pigments." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Corbin, Thomas W.</em></li>
