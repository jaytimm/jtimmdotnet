            <li><strong>We should consider</strong> how little there is in this country besides the tributes, for the support of the encomendero or such person who has to represent him; and that, if the Indians should cease to pay the tributes, all would go to destruction; and even were religious instruction to exist, there would be no system for applying it. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/13701/13701-h/13701-h.htm#:~:text=We%20should%20consider%20how%20little%20there%20is%20in%20this%20country%20besides%20the%20tributes%2C%20for%20the%20support%20of%20the%20encomendero%20or%20such%20person%20who%20has%20to%20represent%20him%3B%20and%20that%2C%20if%20the%20Indians%20should%20cease%20to%20pay%20the%20tributes%2C%20all%20would%20go%20to%20destruction%3B%20and%20even%20were%20religious%20instruction%20to%20exist%2C%20there%20would%20be%20no%20system%20for%20applying%20it." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Unknown Author</em></li>
