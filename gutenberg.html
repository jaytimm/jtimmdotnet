            <li><strong>We can remember</strong> the effect produced upon the Academicians by the appearance of Whistler; but in those recent days opinion had been educated to recognise excellencies in painting, and it was only the novelty and disregard of existing convention that disturbed them. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/50315/50315-h/50315-h.htm#:~:text=We%20can%20remember%20the%20effect%20produced%20upon%20the%20Academicians%20by%20the%20appearance%20of%20Whistler%3B%20but%20in%20those%20recent%20days%20opinion%20had%20been%20educated%20to%20recognise%20excellencies%20in%20painting%2C%20and%20it%20was%20only%20the%20novelty%20and%20disregard%20of%20existing%20convention%20that%20disturbed%20them." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Davies, Randall</em></li>

            <li><strong>We can remember</strong> hearing of a great London dinner at which the lions were the gifted Prince, the husband of the Queen, and the distorted shadow of George Stephenson, the bourgeois creator of a network of railway lines, a Bourse of railway shares; the winner, as it was then supposed, of a huge fortune. | <em>Tytler, Sarah</em></li>
