          <ul>
            <li><strong>We had hoped that this gift would come earlier, so that more of this summer’s guests could enjoy it.</strong> | Lavell, Edith</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to reach the big pan by nightfall, as there was a big krantz there where we could shelter; but it became evident that we could not do so, and we turned aside towards a small pan where a few bushes gave promise of a fire at least, for it became evident that we were in for rain again.</strong> | Cornell, Fred C.</li>
            <li><strong>WE had hoped to have been able without exceeding the prescribed limits of the present volume to have added here a somewhat extensive chapter on the cookery of other countries, and to have comprised in it a section adapted to the service of the Jewish table; but we have so much enlarged in the pages on the more important subject of “Bread,” and on other matters which relate to simple _English_ domestic economy, that we find it necessary to depart from our original intention, and to confine our receipts here to a comparatively small number.</strong> | Acton, Eliza</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped a Carthusian would say mass, but in this were disappointed, for a secular priest had been requested to do so by the ladies of his party.</strong> | Various</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to get a certain amount of game, and an occasional sheep or goat from the natives, but their crowd of mongrel dogs had caught or driven away the former, and they demanded an exorbitant price for the latter, so that we had for a time to depend on our tinned stores.</strong> | Cornell, Fred C.</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to reach the upper part of the lake by means of a steamer, but found this impossible, and were therefore obliged to go on sleds to our first hunting ground--a moose country to the south of the head waters of the Fisher River, between Lake Winnipeg and Lake Winnipegosis.</strong> | Unknown Author</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped that the Taylor bequest would have established at Oxford, not only a picture gallery, but a professorship of Painting and Sculpture.</strong> | Various</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped great things of you, Erica.</strong> | Lyall, Edna</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped it would have been in the little chapel of our house, but it seems some special permission was necessary, and they applied for it too late.</strong> | Procter, Adelaide Anne</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped, indeed, that other times would come, and that the young Elector would shove that old tyrant of a Stadtholder aside, and oust him from his dignities and offices.</strong> | Mühlbach, L.</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to find the valley of clouds, and the great cloud cataract, on the road to Juquila, but were doomed to disappointment.</strong> | Starr, Frederick</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to reach Amphissa, seven miles from Itea, and then make our arrangements for climbing the mountain before going to sleep.</strong> | Richardson, Rufus B.</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped it might be our own people, but they appear to be a few miles further off.</strong> | Baillie, Frederick David</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to sail in the autumn, but we had our full share of the troubles and delays which seem inevitably associated with yacht-building: the engine was months late in the installation, and then had to be rectified; the painting took twice as long as had been promised; and when we put out for trial trips there was trouble with the anchor which necessitated a return to harbour.</strong> | Routledge, Katherine</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to get lunch at a spring that I knew of some twelve miles from my ranch, but when we reached it we found it dry and went on without halting.</strong> | Unknown Author</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped that Dr. Castle might accompany us on our journey.</strong> | Starr, Frederick</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to do it with a considerable force; but late in June the men get scattered.</strong> | Richardson, Rufus B.</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped that the move to the      country undertaken entirely on her account would have been      beneficial to her, entailing as it did a great sacrifice on my part      who need the inspiration of a congenial literary _milieu_ so much.</strong> | Cholmondeley, Mary</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to get donkeys, oxen, or horses from the natives, but these had been driven away into the mountains when a rumour had spread that the Germans intended crossing, and nothing would induce them to bring them back.</strong> | Cornell, Fred C.</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to have the money to build an additional wing to the house and take all our people; but we have not been able to get the money, so we have to tell a great many whom we have promised that they cannot go this year, and--I am afraid it will be a great disappointment."</strong> | Cooper, Elizabeth</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped that Lord Nugent would have been able to collect, from family papers and local traditions, much new and interesting information respecting the life and character of the renowned leader of the Long Parliament, the first of those great English commoners whose plain addition of Mister has, to our ears, a more majestic sound than the proudest of the feudal titles.</strong> | Macaulay, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped that the Air Force, now that it had won its battle for autonomy and demonstrated its decisive character, would welcome an opportunity to plead its case before a public tribunal.</strong> | Wilson, Eugene E.</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to start our man from Papalo back with our horses early; the officials had promised that the _mozo_ to accompany him should be ready; but, of course, neither breakfast nor _mozo_ was to be seen.</strong> | Starr, Frederick</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped that that wretched telegram had been lost somewhere, but it turned out that it had only been "hung up" at Shanghai, and when the _Ringdove_ came down with the Admiral’s answer to the Captain’s letters, she brought it with her.</strong> | Jeans, T. T.</li>
            <li><strong>We had hoped to have a look at the trenches round the lake of Doberdo, about three-quarters of a mile away from the village, but with the firing so intense and showing every sign of increasing rather than diminishing, it would have been madness to have attempted to get there, as it was right out in the open.</strong> | Price, Julius M.</li>
