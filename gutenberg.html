            <li><strong>He must remember</strong> that the government of his own country is a mere experiment, compared with the old monarchies of Europe, and he must try to judge impartially between them. | <em>Fairbanks, Charles Bullard</em></li>
            <li><strong>He must remember</strong> that life has its duties and responsibilities as well as its pleasures; that these begin in boyhood, and that they cannot be evaded without injury to heart and mind and soul. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/69531/69531-h/69531-h.htm#:~:text=He%20must%20remember%20that%20life%20has%20its%20duties%20and%20responsibilities%20as%20well%20as%20its%20pleasures%3B%20that%20these%20begin%20in%20boyhood%2C%20and%20that%20they%20cannot%20be%20evaded%20without%20injury%20to%20heart%20and%20mind%20and%20soul." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Comegys, B.

            <li><strong>He must remember</strong> that the plural of "mouse" is "mice," but that the plural of "house" is not "hice," that he may speak of his two "sons," but not of his two "childs"; he will indistinguishably refer to "sheeps" and "ships"; and like the preacher a little unfamiliar with English who had chosen a well-known text to preach on, he will not remember whether "plough" is pronounced "pluff" or "plo,"[240] and even a phonetic spelling system would render still more confusing the confusion between such a series of words as "hair," "hare," "heir," "are," "ere" and "eyre." <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22090/22090-h/22090-h.htm#:~:text=He%20must%20remember%20that%20the%20plural%20of%20%22mouse%22%20is%20%22mice%2C%22%20but%20that%20the%20plural%20of%20%22house%22%20is%20not%20%22hice%2C%22%20that%20he%20may%20speak%20of%20his%20two%20%22sons%2C%22%20but%20not%20of%20his%20two%20%22childs%22%3B%20he%20will%20indistinguishably%20refer%20to%20%22sheeps%22%20and%20%22ships%22%3B%20and%20like%20the%20preacher%20a%20little%20unfamiliar%20with%20English%20who%20had%20chosen%20a%20well-known%20text%20to%20preach%20on%2C%20he%20will%20not%20remember%20whether%20%22plough%22%20is%20pronounced%20%22pluff%22%20or%20%22plo%2C%22%5B240%5D%20and%20even%20a%20phonetic%20spelling%20system%20would%20render%20still%20more%20confusing%20the%20confusion%20between%20such%20a%20series%20of%20words%20as%20%22hair%2C%22%20%22hare%2C%22%20%22heir%2C%22%20%22are%2C%22%20%22ere%22%20and%20%22eyre.%22" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Ellis, Havelock</em></li>
