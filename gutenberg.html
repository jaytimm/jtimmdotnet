            <li><strong><strong>She had always wanted</strong> to be respectable Mrs. Pugsley, only she had been taken away from the young man, and told not to see him again, and farm-maids have to be obedient.</strong> | Trevena, John</li>
            <li><strong><strong>She had always wanted</strong> someone to rule her--she felt strangely humble, knowing her own weakness.</strong> | Kummer, Frederic Arnold</li>
            <li><strong><strong>She had always wanted</strong> it from the day, two thousand years and more ago, when the first Teuton tribes came over the Alpine barrier and spread through the sun-kissed fields of northern Italy.</strong> | Herrick, Robert</li>
            <li><strong><strong>She had always wanted</strong> to know how she stood towards Rousseau.</strong> | Wells, H. G.</li>
