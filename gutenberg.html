            <li><strong><strong>I often thought</strong> I must be dreaming when I beheld these poor creatures, whom I had pictured to myself as roaming free through their native forests, exercising such occupations in shops and rooms!</strong> | Pfeiffer, Ida</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I often thought</strong> that this novel might perhaps share the fate of my Poem of the World, and find its way into the fire.</strong> | Ebers, Georg</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I often thought</strong> whether there was any reason to tell you, and often and often I felt you ought to know; but you're a wise and far-seeing man, and I wasn't the only one to be thought on.</strong> | Phillpotts, Eden</li>

            <li><strong><strong>I often thought</strong> while I was rambling about the island, that without money I should have been unhappy, and that I was indebted to my gold for all the happiness I was enjoying; but it was right to suppose at the same time that, if I had not felt my purse pretty heavy, I would not have been likely to leave Corfu.</strong> | Casanova, Giacomo</li>

            <li><strong><strong>I often thought</strong> of going to Dublin; and reflected with pride on the fact that I was getting to be a man, and would be able to protect my relatives from any ill-treatment they might have received at the hands of Mr Leary.</strong> | Reid, Mayne</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I often thought</strong> how nice it must be for those baby orioles to be rocked by the wind and to have such a fine musician for their father.</strong> | Patteson, S. Louise</li>
