            <li><strong>I always believed that a preacher ought to fill his engagements promptly unless providentially hindered, and then he ought to be fair enough not to blame providence with too much; but few days are ever too cold and stormy, or nights too dark to keep a man from his appointments if he is anxious to preach the word and minister to his people.</strong> | Weekley, W. M.</li>
            <li><strong>I always believed that he heard me speaking German--it was just after I had come back across the lines.</strong> | Oppenheim, E. Phillips</li>
            <li><strong>I always believed that it was to quiet his tongue.</strong> | Crowninshield, Schuyler, Mrs.</li>
            <li><strong>I always believed my title to the property I hold to be clear, and never could imagine upon what just ground you claimed to contest it.</strong> | Arthur, T. S.</li>
            <li><strong>I always believed in life rather than in books.</strong> | Holmes, Oliver Wendell</li>
