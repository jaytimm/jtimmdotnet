            <li><strong>We should look</strong> for the delineation of a soul harassed and haunted by one idea; torn by the conflict between conscience and filial obedience; or balancing advantage and peril in an agony of suspense and vacillation; forecasting consequence and result to himself and others; and so absorbed in this terrible secret as to exclude all other interests. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25957/25957-h/25957-h.htm#:~:text=We%20should%20look%20for%20the%20delineation%20of%20a%20soul%20harassed%20and%20haunted%20by%20one%20idea%3B%20torn%20by%20the%20conflict%20between%20conscience%20and%20filial%20obedience%3B%20or%20balancing%20advantage%20and%20peril%20in%20an%20agony%20of%20suspense%20and%20vacillation%3B%20forecasting%20consequence%20and%20result%20to%20himself%20and%20others%3B%20and%20so%20absorbed%20in%20this%20terrible%20secret%20as%20to%20exclude%20all%20other%20interests." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Various</em></li>
