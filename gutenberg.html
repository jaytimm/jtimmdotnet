            <li><strong>He suddenly realized that he had left his mackinaw somewhere—probably back in the grocery store, when he had walked out so hastily.</strong> | Saxon, Carl</li>
            <li><strong>He suddenly realized that his fingers were digging into something hard until they hurt.</strong> | Brown, Martin</li>

            <li><strong>He suddenly realized that for all his impetuosity, the woman who walked so calmly by his side held the cards.</strong> | Oppenheim, E. Phillips</li>
            <li><strong>He suddenly realized it, he looked at her suddenly with the lightning of his wild-animal glance and he found her beautiful, was aware of her as a woman, white as milk, and he knew her for a priestess full of secret knowledge.</strong> | Couperus, Louis</li>
            <li><strong>He suddenly realized that he was ruined, and he caught her by the neck to stop her mouth from uttering these heartrending, dreadful screams.</strong> | Maupassant, Guy de</li>
            <li><strong>He suddenly realized that they were alone, the others having filed out into the promenade, and, placing a chair for her in the extreme rear corner of the box, where he could fence her off, sat down beside her.</strong> | Chester, George Randolph</li>
            <li><strong>He suddenly realized that he could get more promptly to the manager or the ringmaster from the rear.</strong> | Harkness, Peter T.</li>
