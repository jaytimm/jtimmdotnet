          <p>They often found themselves incredulous, struggling to accept the truths that challenged their perceptions and beliefs, revealing a deep-seated desire for understanding and clarity in a perplexing world. (openai/gpt-4o-mini) (openai/gpt-4o-mini)</p>

            <li><strong>They could not believe any one was so densely ignorant, as not to know that the Campbells hated the Stuarts.</strong> | Barr, Amelia E.</li>
            <li><strong>They could not believe that such treachery existed within their own ranks.</strong> | Du Bois, Shirley Graham</li>
            <li><strong>They could not believe that Venice, which had continually grown in wealth during ten centuries, could decline or perish.</strong> | Thayer, William Roscoe</li>
            <li><strong>They could not believe Mr. Lincoln when at the pressing moment he pleaded with them so earnestly to accept the terms, and flavored his appeal with the humorous remark to Mr. Crittenden: "You Southern men will soon reach the point where bonds will be a more valuable possession than bondsmen.</strong> | Blaine, James Gillespie</li>
            <li><strong>They could not believe that any tackle could withstand for long this Titanic force.</strong> | Burroughs, Edgar Rice</li>
            <li><strong>They could not believe that these apparently mild and easy-going fellows could really be the terrible savages they tried to make themselves appear.</strong> | Stockton, Frank R.</li>
            <li><strong>They could not believe that Sheila would not come back and patch up a peace with Reben and Eldon and let the success continue.</strong> | Hughes, Rupert</li>
            <li><strong>They could not believe... Because they would not, saith St. Augustine, Tract.</strong> | Unknown Author</li>
            <li><strong>They could not believe, they said, that it was her Majesty's desire to use such language as had been addressed to them, and they therefore implored her plainly to declare her intentions, in order that they might waste no more time unnecessarily, especially as the high offices with which their sovereign had honoured them did not allow them to remain for a long time absent from France.</strong> | Motley, John Lothrop</li>
            <li><strong>They could not believe in God or in immortality: but they believed in reason as a Catholic believes in the Pope, or as a fetish-worshiper believes in his idol.</strong> | Rolland, Romain</li>
            <li><strong>They could not believe in such clemency; but no sooner had they realised the fact, than their stolid, sulky look was exchanged for one of extravagant joy, and their delight after having resigned themselves to death knew no bounds.</strong> | Fenn, George Manville</li>
