            <li><strong>We looked into</strong> each other’s faces in silence, but, though no word was spoken, on every countenance we read the determination of a brave man, to die sooner than to submit. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65155/65155-h/65155-h.htm#:~:text=We%20looked%20into%20each%20other%E2%80%99s%20faces%20in%20silence%2C%20but%2C%20though%20no%20word%20was%20spoken%2C%20on%20every%20countenance%20we%20read%20the%20determination%20of%20a%20brave%20man%2C%20to%20die%20sooner%20than%20to%20submit." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Various</em></li>
            <li><strong>We looked into</strong> the sheds, as they are called, where the boilers for the ships are constructed, and could scarcely hear ourselves speak, from the noise of hammers driving in the rivets. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25032/25032-h/25032-h.htm#:~:text=We%20looked%20into%20the%20sheds%2C%20as%20they%20are%20called%2C%20where%20the%20boilers%20for%20the%20ships%20are%20constructed%2C%20and%20could%20scarcely%20hear%20ourselves%20speak%2C%20from%20the%20noise%20of%20hammers%20driving%20in%20the%20rivets." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Kingston, William Henry Giles</em></li>
            <li><strong>We looked into</strong> the garden at the Place, where Hilary particularly called my attention to the kidney-beans; for, said he, if the kidney-beans run up the sticks well, with a strong vine, then it would be a capital hop-year. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20528/20528-h/20528-h.htm#:~:text=We%20looked%20into%20the%20garden%20at%20the%20Place%2C%20where%20Hilary%20particularly%20called%20my%20attention%20to%20the%20kidney-beans%3B%20for%2C%20said%20he%2C%20if%20the%20kidney-beans%20run%20up%20the%20sticks%20well%2C%20with%20a%20strong%20vine%2C%20then%20it%20would%20be%20a%20capital%20hop-year." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Jefferies, Richard</em></li>
            <li><strong>We looked into</strong> the ancient sombre Cathedral, with its beautiful modern stained-glass windows, and visited the University, with its museum and library--the museum bequeathed by William Hunter, the great surgeon, who gave at the same time 8,000 pounds to erect a building for its reception. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25032/25032-h/25032-h.htm#:~:text=We%20looked%20into%20the%20ancient%20sombre%20Cathedral%2C%20with%20its%20beautiful%20modern%20stained-glass%20windows%2C%20and%20visited%20the%20University%2C%20with%20its%20museum%20and%20library--the%20museum%20bequeathed%20by%20William%20Hunter%2C%20the%20great%20surgeon%2C%20who%20gave%20at%20the%20same%20time%208%2C000%20pounds%20to%20erect%20a%20building%20for%20its%20reception." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Kingston, William Henry Giles</em></li>
            <li><strong>We looked into</strong> the belfries, where the pendulous bells were waiting in vain for the summons which should awaken their marriage peals; together we touched the mighty organ keys, that sang no _jubilates_ for the ear of Heaven--that sang no requiems for the ear of human sorrow; together we searched the silent nurseries, where the children were all asleep, and _had_ been asleep through five generations. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25207/25207-h/25207-h.htm#:~:text=We%20looked%20into%20the%20belfries%2C%20where%20the%20pendulous%20bells%20were%20waiting%20in%20vain%20for%20the%20summons%20which%20should%20awaken%20their%20marriage%20peals%3B%20together%20we%20touched%20the%20mighty%20organ%20keys%2C%20that%20sang%20no%20_jubilates_%20for%20the%20ear%20of%20Heaven--that%20sang%20no%20requiems%20for%20the%20ear%20of%20human%20sorrow%3B%20together%20we%20searched%20the%20silent%20nurseries%2C%20where%20the%20children%20were%20all%20asleep%2C%20and%20_had_%20been%20asleep%20through%20five%20generations." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Various</em></li>
            <li><strong>We looked into</strong> one window, about three feet square, and made a mental inventory of its contents:--Six Spanish onions; a plateful of wooden dolls, leering with vacuous glances at a tin of sardines; four tin money-boxes; three plates of apples (incarnate stomach-aches); a cake of blacking; two cakes of soap (whose name wild horses shall not drag from me); five peg-tops; one plum cake; and, casting a greasy light over all, a tallow dip in a brass candlestick. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58898/58898-h/58898-h.htm#:~:text=We%20looked%20into%20one%20window%2C%20about%20three%20feet%20square%2C%20and%20made%20a%20mental%20inventory%20of%20its%20contents%3A--Six%20Spanish%20onions%3B%20a%20plateful%20of%20wooden%20dolls%2C%20leering%20with%20vacuous%20glances%20at%20a%20tin%20of%20sardines%3B%20four%20tin%20money-boxes%3B%20three%20plates%20of%20apples%20%28incarnate%20stomach-aches%29%3B%20a%20cake%20of%20blacking%3B%20two%20cakes%20of%20soap%20%28whose%20name%20wild%20horses%20shall%20not%20drag%20from%20me%29%3B%20five%20peg-tops%3B%20one%20plum%20cake%3B%20and%2C%20casting%20a%20greasy%20light%20over%20all%2C%20a%20tallow%20dip%20in%20a%20brass%20candlestick." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Harper, Charles G.</em></li>
