          <p>She was observant and perceptive, always attuned to the emotions and surroundings of others. (openai/gpt-4o-mini)</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>She could see groups of people below.</strong> | Muddock, J. E.</li>
            <li><strong>She could see it in the faces of people as they greeted her in the park,--especially in the faces of the men.</strong> | Trollope, Anthony</li>
            <li><strong>She could see the Ray rising above the marshes, bathed in moonlight, patched with coal black shadows cast by the ancient thorn trees, and the farm buildings.</strong> | Baring-Gould, S.</li>
            <li><strong>She could see the man’s face indistinctly; the white bandage around his head.</strong> | Fellom, James</li>
            <li><strong>She could see a dark belt, the "seam" of which Garland had spoken, partially exposed.</strong> | Chisholm, A. M.</li>
            <li><strong>She could see, back of her, in the light of the burning bridge, one of the armed men standing to watch the road; ahead of her, but almost indistinguishable in the darkness, was another.</strong> | MacHarg, William</li>
            <li><strong>She could see nothing outwardly, but was not astonished at what I told her, because she knew that I was sometimes in an extraordinary state, without her being able to understand the cause.</strong> | Emmerich, Anna Katharina</li>
            <li><strong>She could see distinctly by the intense red light, nearly every countenance there, but did not recognize that of Mr. Somers.</strong> | Savage, William T., Mrs.</li>
            <li><strong>She could see each object on the shining sideboard.</strong> | Richardson, Dorothy M.</li>
            <li><strong>She could see little patches of blue sky between the tangled tufts of drooping leaves, and, as the dazzling sunlight had faded, she began to think it was getting late, and that very soon it would be night.</strong> | Pedley, Ethel C.</li>
            <li><strong>She could see from the way he smiled that he felt that she knew as little about the conditions under which books are printed as a child does about the paving of the streets of the City.</strong> | Moore, Frank Frankfort</li>
            <li><strong>She could see the lawn and the road before the house.</strong> | MacHarg, William</li>
            <li><strong>She could see McTaggart.</strong> | Curwood, James Oliver</li>
            <li><strong>She could see a man standing in the stone parlour with a lantern in his hand.</strong> | Deeping, Warwick</li>
            <li><strong>She could see that he was deliberately delaying.</strong> | Seltzer, Charles Alden</li>
            <li><strong>She could see nothing before her--nothing but this dark, monotonous, aching present moment, pervaded by the dropping sounds of that faint, half-articulate voice.</strong> | Oliphant, Mrs.</li>
            <li><strong>She could see that a large branch had broken from a tall tree, and lay upon the ground and--yes, something else lay beside or on it, half concealed from her view by the green leaves and twigs; and--did she hear a groan?</strong> | Finley, Martha</li>
            <li><strong>She could see him also, this other man, devouring her with his fixed look; and, if he had been near her at that moment, she would have flung herself into his arms!</strong> | Maupassant, Guy de</li>
            <li><strong>She could see him anywhere, if he would.</strong> | Dreiser, Theodore</li>
            <li><strong>She could see them devouring the wooden tarred walls.</strong> | Baring-Gould, S.</li>
            <li><strong>She could see the stable with white chickens busy around it and a cow and a calf in the lot beside it.</strong> | Stratton-Porter, Gene</li>
            <li><strong>She could see him beyond the drawbridge gazing blindly out into the darkness.</strong> | Aitken, Robert</li>
            <li><strong>She could see Armand in her thought, and as it were a wave of blood, but having greater heat, surged to her heart, her throat choked a little, and her will tottered.</strong> | Bourget, Paul</li>
            <li><strong>She could see Billy, gay and careless.</strong> | Dawson, Coningsby</li>
            <li><strong>She could see they were all out of temper, and it made her very sorry.</strong> | Andersen, H. C.</li>
