          <ul>
            <li><strong>He could never get in sympathy with the bent of individuality, the Southern passion and fire, and the exceptional gifts of temperament which made Paganini's idiosyncrasies of style as a player consummate beauties, where imitations of these effects on the part of others would be gross exaggeration.</strong> | Ferris, George T.</li>
            <li><strong>He could never repay it, he told himself, save inadequately, little by little--mostly by gratitude and such consideration as he purposed now to exhibit by removing himself and his distresses from the other's ken.</strong> | Vance, Louis Joseph</li>
            <li><strong>He could never learn that the earth would not rest on its axis, while he wrote a programme of the way it was to turn.</strong> | Motley, John Lothrop</li>
            <li><strong>He could never resist the dread of the deadly atmosphere of the room.</strong> | Cullum, Ridgwell</li>
            <li><strong>He could never keep pace with the other in the race for liberty, nor would he be fitted for the proper use of his liberty until he had practised industry under a natural and healthy stimulus up to the paying point--the point when he becomes convinced in his own mind that honesty is the best policy.</strong> | Unknown Author</li>
            <li><strong>He could never fix his thoughts, nor govern his estate, tho' then the greatest in _England_.</strong> | Unknown Author</li>
            <li><strong>He could never learn that the earth would not rest on its axis, while he wrote a programme of the way it was to turn.</strong> | Motley, John Lothrop</li>
            <li><strong>He could never content himself with stereotyped employment.</strong> | Cullum, Ridgwell</li>
            <li><strong>He could never bear to be found fault with.</strong> | Wood, Henry, Mrs.</li>
            <li><strong>He could never emancipate himself till he or they should die.</strong> | Oliphant, Mrs.</li>
            <li><strong>He could never more than superficially ruffle the spirit of his wife.</strong> | Palmer, John</li>
            <li><strong>He could never quite understand this method of procedure.</strong> | Adams, Bernard</li>
            <li><strong>He could never take a fiercer stand against odds than now if he lived to be a hundred.</strong> | Freeman, Mary Eleanor Wilkins</li>
            <li><strong>He could never forgive a politician for taking the right course, unless it was taken from a wrong motive."</strong> | Melville, Lewis</li>
            <li><strong>He could never, he said, ascertain their names, for whenever he asked Althotas the question, he was told that it would be dangerous for him to know.</strong> | Mackay, Charles</li>
            <li><strong>He could never look very much farther than his own place in the world and the road that led to it.</strong> | Phillpotts, Eden</li>
            <li><strong>He could never look at her again without being reminded of those infinite latent possibilities, without wondering what new and perhaps more charming, more surprising varieties of look and tone and manner could be evoked.</strong> | Phillips, David Graham</li>
            <li><strong>He could never have guessed, from anything in their seeming, that the long perspective of gazing orbs, vanishing into nothingness, were not more sightless than their originals.</strong> | De Morgan, William</li>
            <li><strong>He could never catch us, that was certain.</strong> | London, Jack</li>
            <li><strong>He could never reach Fred in time.</strong> | Pollock, Frank Lillie</li>
            <li><strong>He could never be convinced that it was unreasonable that he should have the principal command; but when it was represented to him, that since that opinion prevailed, whether well or ill founded, the Prince's affairs might equally suffer, he took his resolution in a moment; said he never had anything in view but the Prince's interest, and would cheerfully sacrifice everything to it.</strong> | Thomson, A. T., Mrs.</li>
            <li><strong>He could never be aught than a soldier of fortune.</strong> | Train, Arthur Cheney</li>
            <li><strong>He could never study when a fly buzzed on the window-pane; he was always standing on the toes of his bare feet, trying to locate and understand the buzz that puzzled him.</strong> | Wiggin, Kate Douglas Smith</li>
            <li><strong>He could never have said no to Mrs. Beamish when she came to him for money--rather would he have pawned the coat off his back.</strong> | Richardson, Henry Handel</li>
            <li><strong>He could never though have got Polly to see it.</strong> | Richardson, Henry Handel</li>
