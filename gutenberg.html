            <li><strong>He must look</strong> to heaven for the means to move men to repent; he must appeal to God, keep God and his works before his audience, and in this way show that his confidence is in Christianity itself, and the author of it, and not in himself, not in man. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56404/56404-h/56404-h.htm#:~:text=He%20must%20look%20to%20heaven%20for%20the%20means%20to%20move%20men%20to%20repent%3B%20he%20must%20appeal%20to%20God%2C%20keep%20God%20and%20his%20works%20before%20his%20audience%2C%20and%20in%20this%20way%20show%20that%20his%20confidence%20is%20in%20Christianity%20itself%2C%20and%20the%20author%20of%20it%2C%20and%20not%20in%20himself%2C%20not%20in%20man." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Franklin, Benjamin</em></li>
