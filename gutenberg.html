            <strong>I remembered the</strong> day when the Saviour appeared to me—when denser, darker prison-bands were sundered. | <em>Geer, John James</em>
          </blockquote>
          <ul>

            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> little meadow on the Rapidan, and the tale told by the grey ashes. | <em>Buchan, John</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> fable, however, of the hare and the tortoise: "Sure and steady wins the race." | <em>Kingston, William Henry Giles</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> works of the Lord:  for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning. | <em>Unknown Author</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> line of Zhukovsky (in the passage where he speaks of the murder of field-marshal Kamensky): | <em>Turgenev, Ivan Sergeevich</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> first time I saw Larry and Jean, and the bit of poetry he said to her. | <em>Whiteley, Opal Stanley</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> old doctor,--'It would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals, on the spot.' | <em>Conrad, Joseph</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> short ladder leaning against the low wall and felt sure he had arranged his criminal approach long before. | <em>Chesterton, G. K.</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> promises I had made, and my conscience accused me of having broken them almost as soon as made. | <em>Billany, George</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong>n often to have seen sheep's wool hanging to these wires; and one of them is very much loosened. | <em>Selous, Edmund</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong>se things a few weeks later, when General Grant‘s first words to me at Washington were: “Glad to meet you. | <em>Dilke, Charles Wentworth, Sir</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> feasts I had in Toledo, how well I ate with my German friends, and that good wine I used to announce in the streets. | <em>Anonymous</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> matches I had stood up in the sand at Grandma's, and how the flame had leaped from match to match until it reached the last one. | <em>Johnson, Clarence Edgar</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> love I had borne your father, and my duty to him, to see that no such wrong was done you in the end as that which I feared. | <em>Sabatini, Rafael</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong>e, my brother, and all of thy household; at the last moment thou alone wert in my mind; here, only, I learned how I loved thee, my dear brother!... | <em>Dupuy, Ernest</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> stories I had heard that day in the tavern at Pojetta, and the talk of the mystic melodies by which travellers had been drawn to the anchorite's abode. | <em>Sabatini, Rafael</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> fearful danger Oliver and I had escaped when carried off by the Papuans from our island; and I prayed that we might be again preserved from a similar catastrophe. | <em>Kingston, William Henry Giles</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> lie of the land quite well, ever since that night when the fire happened; so I halted my men in a little wood, and left them to eat their suppers, while I slung my spy-glass and proceeded to reconnoitre the enemy. | <em>Blackmore, R. D.</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> tragedy of the unfortunate Adams and the still more unfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the latter; and how poor Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams, and imprudently permitting himself to get wildly excited, was at unawares hurried into his fatal act—an act which certainly no man could possibly deplore more than the actor himself. | <em>Melville, Herman</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> story of one whose fate was somewhat, if not exactly, similar--the poor Scottish baronet, Sir Robert Innes, who became a private in the foot regiment of Colonel Winram, of Liberton, and remained there long in obscurity, as private Robert Innes, till a former friend recognised him when on duty as sentinel one day before the quarters of the colonel. | <em>Grant, James</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> saying of the Western boy before Petersburg, when he heard for the first time the five o‘clock camp-gun, and called to his next neighbor at the fire, “Say, Bill, did you hap to hear how partic‘lar loud the day broke just now?” for it was the morning-gun, which in Ceylon is always fired at the same time, there being less than an hour‘s difference between the longest and shortest days. | <em>Dilke, Charles Wentworth, Sir</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong>n, that as matters were advanced to this point, a special ambassador must be sent to Spain, to ask the hand of the Infanta for the King, and to sign the compact of marriage; that the ambassador must be a nobleman of mark and title, and thus I begged the Duke to give me this commission, with a recommendation to the King of Spain, so as to make my second son, the Marquis of Ruffec, grandee of Spain. | <em>Saint-Simon, Louis de Rouvroy, duc de</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> lump of beeswax with which I made candles in my African adventure; but I had none of that now; the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me light, though not a clear, steady light, like a candle. | <em>Defoe, Daniel</em></li>
            <li><strong>I remembered the</strong> old cloak she had worn the winter before, how thin and thread-bare it was; but I could not refuse the sweet pleading eyes, which were looking at me with such anxiety, lest I should reject her gift; so I said, 'Well, Jane, since your father and mother both approve, and you yourself are willing to give up your new cloak for the sake of these poor houseless ones, I can only say, God speed your gift, and make you to realize, in its fullest sense, the blessedness of giving!' | <em>Bewsher, M. E., Mrs.</em></li>
