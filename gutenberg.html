          <ul>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> on the morrow he would call upon de Fronsac, whom she doubtless knew now, and ask him for an introduction.</strong> | Merrick, Leonard</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> he disliked it intensely.</strong> | Crompton, Richmal</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> he would go to his sister's for lunch, but he was not sure that he would reveal his woe even to her.</strong> | Harben, Will N.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> the cheapest food he could buy was a five-cent loaf at some baker's.</strong> | Alger, Horatio, Jr.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> it was not beauty, in the strictest sense of the word, but a sort of radiance which emanated from her like an aura.</strong> | Cooke, Marjorie Benton</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> Nesta Mallathorpe was not so much pretty as eminently attractive--a tall, well-developed, warm-coloured young woman, whose clear grey eyes and red lips and general bearing indicated the possession of good health and spirits.</strong> | Fletcher, J. S.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> she must have gone up to her grandfather's room to discuss it with that old gentleman--a reasonable enough hypothesis--and that Captain Stewart must have come in during the discussion.</strong> | Forman, Justus Miles</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> they must have done so.</strong> | Couperus, Louis</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> he must escape.</strong> | Dorrance, E. S.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> he would sound her.</strong> | Harben, Will N.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> what he thought had better be left unsaid.</strong> | Godwin, Tom</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> it was his duty to follow her and proffer his services if she needed them, though in so clandestine a manner that wicked Mrs. Ellsworth need not find it out and revenge herself by cruelty to his master.</strong> | Miller, Alex. McVeigh, Mrs.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> firmly, two months after the prognosis.</strong> | Marlowe, Stephen</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> the young assistant who worked always with his father must supply in himself the needed vision.</strong> | Cobb, Frank</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> they were persons of some consequence, even if they had been sleeping in his barn.</strong> | Aldridge, Janet</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> on the whole he felt pleased.</strong> | Blackwood, Algernon</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> he would arrange for no more European letters      when the six were finished, but would gather material for a book.</strong> | Twain, Mark</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> he could improve himself more at Oxford than at any other place, and at Oxford, therefore, he determined to remain.</strong> | Gibbs, A. Hamilton</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> it was not safe to undress, so he threw himself across his painted bed.</strong> | Aiken, Ednah</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> it would be worth while trying to find out.</strong> | Crofts, Freeman Wills</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> the safest thing was to wait until the very last moment, trying to prolong the issue until it would be too late for Storch to lay other plans.</strong> | Dobie, Charles Caldwell</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> he ought to inform Mr. Frisbone of her condition, though he hardly understood enough of such matters to determine whether any thing was the matter with her.</strong> | Optic, Oliver</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> if he didn’t succeed in getting a place as office boy, he might get the restaurant place.</strong> | Morrison, Harry Steele</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> if the meeting of Porter with the two M. & T. directors were not accidental they would be likely to be in consultation for some time, and he would gain more by inquiring for Mr. Wing at the expiration of a half hour than by doing it now.</strong> | Merwin, Samuel</li>
            <li><strong><strong>He decided that</strong> he would go and investigate, lighted a candle and looked at his watch; it was barely ten o'clock.</strong> | Maupassant, Guy de</li>
