            <li><strong>He could hardly be brought to believe that the haggard and wild-eyed young fellow who answered to Gabriel's name at the fort was the Gabriel that he had known, and when he made up his mind that it really was Gabriel, he couldn't hold the tears back.</strong> | Harris, Joel Chandler</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly have explained why he extended his invitation to Felix.</strong> | Giberne, Agnes</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly spare a day during the winter for running down to Littlebath, and whenever he did do so, he took Coke upon Lyttleton down with him.</strong> | Trollope, Anthony</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly be called a well-read man, nor were his intellectual interests numerous.</strong> | Bryce, James Bryce, Viscount</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly see what they were.</strong> | Jacob, Violet</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly believe that Jack was George's brother.</strong> | Lowndes, Marie Belloc</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly restrain his impatience, as Rollo came in, all eager and smiling, easy and cordial even to himself.</strong> | Oliphant, Mrs.</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly keep back a groan.</strong> | England, George Allan</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly see Eaton’s back as it swayed before him.</strong> | Dudley, Albertus T.</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly stand, and his legs bent under him when he attempted to walk.</strong> | Forbes-Lindsay, C. H.</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly wait until Givens seated himself again before questioning him as to the girl's identity.</strong> | Schuyler, George S.</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly wait until dinner was over to get back to work on it.</strong> | Piper, H. Beam</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly speak in answer to her query, and when he did a sob was in his throat.</strong> | Craddock, Charles Egbert</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly wait with patience till she concluded, saying—</strong> | Various</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly go back to the warm sitting-room without saying something—something more.</strong> | Mansfield, Katherine</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly tear himself away from browsing and gazing.</strong> | Lehmann, Rosamond</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly expect to receive any remittance from Gowanlock and Van Duzer for some months to come, but he would acquaint me with his address from time to time, and, if anything arrived from them I could forward it to him.</strong> | Dent, John Charles</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly believe his own senses, and the terrible idea crossed his mind that his wife had been helping the Czarina in an amorous intrigue, and that very probably he would have to pay the penalty for this piece of complaisance, which he did not in the least care to do.</strong> | Radziwill, Catherine, Princess</li>
            <li><strong>He could hardly get them out quick enough.</strong> | Mitford, Bertram</li>
