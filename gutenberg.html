            <li><strong>He should consider</strong> the proposition made by Sir Thomas Acland in two points of view; with reference to its object of producing discord and bitterness of feeling in the house, and how far such a course was conformable to the professions made by gentlemen opposite with respect to the Irish church. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19218/19218-h/19218-h.htm#:~:text=He%20should%20consider%20the%20proposition%20made%20by%20Sir%20Thomas%20Acland%20in%20two%20points%20of%20view%3B%20with%20reference%20to%20its%20object%20of%20producing%20discord%20and%20bitterness%20of%20feeling%20in%20the%20house%2C%20and%20how%20far%20such%20a%20course%20was%20conformable%20to%20the%20professions%20made%20by%20gentlemen%20opposite%20with%20respect%20to%20the%20Irish%20church." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Farr, Edward</em></li>
            <li><strong>He should consider</strong> that he is a constituent, responsible member of the great family of man, and, while he should pay particular attention to the wants and welfare of those with whom he is immediately connected, he should accustom himself to send his thoughts abroad over the wide field of practical benevolence. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51374/51374-h/51374-h.htm#:~:text=He%20should%20consider%20that%20he%20is%20a%20constituent%2C%20responsible%20member%20of%20the%20great%20family%20of%20man%2C%20and%2C%20while%20he%20should%20pay%20particular%20attention%20to%20the%20wants%20and%20welfare%20of%20those%20with%20whom%20he%20is%20immediately%20connected%2C%20he%20should%20accustom%20himself%20to%20send%20his%20thoughts%20abroad%20over%20the%20wide%20field%20of%20practical%20benevolence." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Ferguson, Smith C.</em></li>
            <li><strong>He should consider</strong> well with himself every minute circumstance that may be of advantage to him during the siege: he should thoroughly examine the several works, and canvas all the different stratagems that may be used, either to defend them, or to give way upon occasion, when overpowered, with an intent to return and dislodge the enemy, after he has got possession of them; in short, how to defend the place entrusted to his care, inch by inch, with the best advantage. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74739/74739-h/74739-h.htm#:~:text=He%20should%20consider%20well%20with%20himself%20every%20minute%20circumstance%20that%20may%20be%20of%20advantage%20to%20him%20during%20the%20siege%3A%20he%20should%20thoroughly%20examine%20the%20several%20works%2C%20and%20canvas%20all%20the%20different%20stratagems%20that%20may%20be%20used%2C%20either%20to%20defend%20them%2C%20or%20to%20give%20way%20upon%20occasion%2C%20when%20overpowered%2C%20with%20an%20intent%20to%20return%20and%20dislodge%20the%20enemy%2C%20after%20he%20has%20got%20possession%20of%20them%3B%20in%20short%2C%20how%20to%20defend%20the%20place%20entrusted%20to%20his%20care%2C%20inch%20by%20inch%2C%20with%20the%20best%20advantage." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Duane, William</em></li>
            <li><strong>He should consider</strong> the place in such a manner, as if the enemy were going to besiege him, not omitting the least thing that may contribute to a long and obstinate defence; he should therefore take particular care to keep the fortifications in good repair; clearing the country round of all hedges, ditches, trees, hollow roads, caverns, and rising grounds, within the reach of cannon shot; not suffering any houses to be built within that distance, nor in general any thing to be done that may favor the approach of an enemy. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74739/74739-h/74739-h.htm#:~:text=He%20should%20consider%20the%20place%20in%20such%20a%20manner%2C%20as%20if%20the%20enemy%20were%20going%20to%20besiege%20him%2C%20not%20omitting%20the%20least%20thing%20that%20may%20contribute%20to%20a%20long%20and%20obstinate%20defence%3B%20he%20should%20therefore%20take%20particular%20care%20to%20keep%20the%20fortifications%20in%20good%20repair%3B%20clearing%20the%20country%20round%20of%20all%20hedges%2C%20ditches%2C%20trees%2C%20hollow%20roads%2C%20caverns%2C%20and%20rising%20grounds%2C%20within%20the%20reach%20of%20cannon%20shot%3B%20not%20suffering%20any%20houses%20to%20be%20built%20within%20that%20distance%2C%20nor%20in%20general%20any%20thing%20to%20be%20done%20that%20may%20favor%20the%20approach%20of%20an%20enemy." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Duane, William</em></li>
            <li><strong>He should consider</strong> how, and in what manner, the works defend each other; whether their communications are safe, or liable to be interrupted by the besiegers; how to incommode the enemy when he is at a distance, or to dislodge him when near; whether the ground be proper for mines, and where they should be made; whether any part of the country may not be laid under water, by means of dykes or sluices: if there are any already made, how to keep them in constant repair, or to make new ones if they are wanted; taking care to construct them so that the enemy may not have it in his power to destroy them, either with his cannon or mortars. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74739/74739-h/74739-h.htm#:~:text=He%20should%20consider%20how%2C%20and%20in%20what%20manner%2C%20the%20works%20defend%20each%20other%3B%20whether%20their%20communications%20are%20safe%2C%20or%20liable%20to%20be%20interrupted%20by%20the%20besiegers%3B%20how%20to%20incommode%20the%20enemy%20when%20he%20is%20at%20a%20distance%2C%20or%20to%20dislodge%20him%20when%20near%3B%20whether%20the%20ground%20be%20proper%20for%20mines%2C%20and%20where%20they%20should%20be%20made%3B%20whether%20any%20part%20of%20the%20country%20may%20not%20be%20laid%20under%20water%2C%20by%20means%20of%20dykes%20or%20sluices%3A%20if%20there%20are%20any%20already%20made%2C%20how%20to%20keep%20them%20in%20constant%20repair%2C%20or%20to%20make%20new%20ones%20if%20they%20are%20wanted%3B%20taking%20care%20to%20construct%20them%20so%20that%20the%20enemy%20may%20not%20have%20it%20in%20his%20power%20to%20destroy%20them%2C%20either%20with%20his%20cannon%20or%20mortars." target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #fc8d62; font-size: 0.8em;" title="View in Project Gutenberg">pg</a> | <em>Duane, William</em></li>
            <li><strong>He should consider</strong> the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue; he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul, and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth, of private and public station, of strength and weakness, of cleverness and dullness, and of all the soul, and the operation of them when conjoined; he will then look at the nature of the soul, and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better and which is the worse; and so he will choose, giving the name of evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust, and good to the life which will make his soul more just; all else he will disregard. | <em>Plato</em></li>
