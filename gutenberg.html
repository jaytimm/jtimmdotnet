          <ul>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> a grateful and thankful heart to praise the Lord God on high for all his mercies!</strong> | Equiano, Olaudah</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> a man of God with whom I might converse: my soul was like the chariots of Aminidab, Canticles vi.</strong> | Equiano, Olaudah</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> the light that I might see Jack’s face, for his voice began to have an odd ring about it.</strong> | Potter, Robert</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> a thousand more drawings in that sale at Amsterdam, but concluded they would be very dear; and not having seen them, I thought it too rash to trouble your ladyship with a large commission.</strong> | Walpole, Horace</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> you to-day; Mr. Chute and Cowslade dined here; the day was divine: the sun gleamed down into the chapel in all the glory of popery; the gallery was all radiance; we drank our coffee on the bench under the great ash-tree; the verdure was delicious; our tea in the Holbein room, by which a thousand chaises and barges passed; and I showed them my new cottage and garden over the way, which they had never seen, and with which they were enchanted.</strong> | Walpole, Horace</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> you; the same scenes strike us both, and the same kind of visions has amused us both ever since we were born.</strong> | Walpole, Horace</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> vengeance upon Abi, and all who cling to him.”</strong> | Haggard, H. Rider</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> the end.</strong> | Service, Robert W.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> it only that I might bring it over the sea, to drop it like a new apple of discord, suited to the spirit of the times, among the anthropologists and evolutionists generally of this old and learned world.</strong> | Hudson, W. H.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> this, but durst not say so much, lest he should be angry; for, as the hours grew on, I found my apprehensions increase, and my silly heart was the unquieter, every time I could lift up my eyes to his dear face; so sweetly terrible did he appear to my apprehensions.</strong> | Richardson, Samuel</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> this all the more as I knew of your affectionate desire that this act of justice should be done.</strong> | Vallery-Radot, René</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> a New Year's gift--the gift of your heart--another gift besides the necklace you have sent me.</strong> | Maupassant, Guy de</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> a world where I could discover this tradition perpetually, and not in pictures and in poems only, but in tiles round the chimney-piece and in the hangings that kept out the draught.</strong> | Yeats, W. B.</li>
            <li><strong><strong>I wished for</strong> his death!</strong> | Tolstoy, Leo, graf</li>
