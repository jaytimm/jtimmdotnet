It makes downloading, setting up, and serving LLMs straightforward, allowing you to utilize their capabilities without depending on online services. Ollama works with a range of LLMs, such as Llama 2 and Mistral, and supplies a simple API for communicating with them. By employing Ollama, you can confirm that your document analysis application functions entirely on-premises, safeguarding your data and removing the requirement for an internet connection. Its effective management of system resources and ability to operate on standard hardware render it a budget-friendly choice for prolonged use. Ollama provides an API that is compatible with OpenAI's standards. Ollama enables models to be hosted for application integration.Step-by-Step Guide to Building Your PDF Query AppInstalling Ollama and Downloading an LLM The initial phase in creating your local PDF query application is to install Ollama, which will act as the core for operating Large Language Models on your device. Ollama streamlines the procedures of acquiring, configuring, and serving LLMs, facilitating an easy start with local document analysis. To install Ollama, go to the official Ollama website and get the correct version for your OS, like macOS or Linux. After downloading, adhere to the setup guidelines on the site. Once Ollama is installed, the subsequent step is to acquire an LLM. Ollama is compatible with various LLMs, including Llama 2 and Mistral. For this tutorial, we will use Mixtral, a high-performance Mixture of Experts model with publicly available weights from Mistral AI. The command is ollama pull mixtral. Please note that downloading the models may take some time.Installing Dependencies To build your document analysis application, you must install a number of dependencies. These consist of Langchain, Streamlit, PyPDF, and other auxiliary packages. The required dependencies are:LangchainStreamlitPyPDFOpenAI (required for Ollama integration)tiktokenpython-dotenvTo install these packages, use the pip package manager. Establish a new virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies from your main Python installation. Utilizing a virtual environment assists in managing project-specific libraries and preventing clashes with other Python endeavors on your computer. Execute the installation script to get the dependencies.Frequently Asked Questions What is Langchain and how does it help in building a PDF query app?Langchain is a framework that makes it easier to work with Large Language Models. It supplies tools and structures for developing applications that use LLMs, including organizing prompts, processing sequences, and automated tools for document handling, summarization, and querying. Why should I choose to build a local PDF query app over using cloud-based services?Creating a local PDF query app provides superior data security, removes ongoing subscription fees, and grants you full autonomy over your information. It prevents reliance on external providers and decreases the likelihood of security issues, making it perfect for managing confidential data. Can I use different LLMs with this setup, or am I limited to Llama 2 and Mistral?Although this guide highlights Llama 2 and Mistral, Ollama supports a wide array of LLMs. You can experiment with other available models and incorporate them into your application depending on your particular needs and preferences.Related Questions How does the 'stuffing' method work in Langchain for document summarization?The 'stuffing' method works by placing all relevant text into the query's context, merging every document into a single prompt for the language model. It feeds the complete text directly into the LLM, which is appropriate for smaller documents that can entirely fit within the model's processing limit. The 'stuffing' technique works well with shorter texts. For more extensive documents, other models tend to be more efficient. What is the 'map reduce' method and how is it used for querying documents?The 'map reduce' method is a multi-stage process that examines each page individually to locate pertinent information. It entails breaking documents into sections, summarizing each part separately, and then merging these summaries for a conclusive output. Map Reduce is better suited for larger files or situations where certain document segments require more thorough investigation. To apply the map reduce method, begin by loading all documents and their pages. Next, you will retrieve the text content from these pages and execute your query.
