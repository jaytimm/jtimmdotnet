                        In our fast-paced digital world, the ability to quickly understand the core message of a video is incredibly valuable. For researchers, students, and professionals alike, generating concise summaries of lengthy YouTube videos can be a major time-saver and productivity booster. This guide offers a clear, step-by-step method for using Langchain, OpenAI, and Whisper to automatically create summaries of YouTube content. You'll learn how to write Python scripts in Google Colab to extract audio, transcribe it into text, and then condense it using powerful AI models.  Key PointsLearn to use Langchain, OpenAI, and Whisper for automated video summarization.Write Python code in Google Colab to download and transcribe video audio.Apply text splitting and summarization methods to create concise overviews.Implement the map reduce chain technique for efficiently summarizing large documents.Utilize the OpenAI API to access advanced summarization models.Use the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to divide text into smaller, manageable pieces.Setting Up Your Environment for Video SummarizationGetting Started with Google ColabFirst, make sure you have a Google account to access Google Colab, a free, cloud-based platform ideal for running Python code. Open Google Colab and create a new notebook. This will be your workspace for the video summarization project. Rename the notebook to something memorable, like 'YouTube_Summarizer', to help you stay organized.Next, adjust the runtime configuration. Go to the 'Runtime' menu and select 'Change runtime type'. From the dropdown, choose 'T4 GPU' as your hardware accelerator. This selection uses the GPU's processing power to speed up your code execution. Save the settings to apply them to your Colab environment. Now, you're ready to install the necessary packages.Installing Essential Python PackagesBefore writing the code, you must install the required Python libraries. These packages provide the tools for audio extraction, transcription, and summarization. Run the following commands in a Colab cell using pip install:!pip install OpenAI!pip install -U openai-whisper!pip install pytube!pip install langchainOpenAI: This library enables interaction with OpenAI's language models, which are crucial for text summarization.Whisper: OpenAI's automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, used to convert audio into text.Pytube: A library for downloading audio directly from YouTube videos.Langchain: A powerful framework that offers a standard interface for chains and other tools, simplifying the process of building applications with language models.These commands will install the OpenAI, Whisper, Pytube, and Langchain libraries, giving you all the tools needed for the next steps. Once the installations finish, you can import these packages into your script.Extracting Audio from YouTube VideosImporting Pytube and Loading the VideoStart by importing the pytube library, which allows you to download audio from YouTube. After importing, specify the URL of the YouTube video you want to process.The following code shows how to do this:import pytube as ptyt = pt.YouTube("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd1kN_myNDs")stream = yt.streams.filter(only_audio=True)[0]stream.download(filename='yt_audio.mp3')This code creates a YouTube object using the provided URL, filters the available streams to select the audio-only option, and downloads it as an MP3 file named yt_audio.mp3. This file will be used for transcription in the next stage.Transcribing Audio with WhisperWith the audio file downloaded, the next step is to convert it to text using OpenAI's Whisper model. Whisper is a robust tool for speech-to-text conversion, available via the openai-whisper library you installed earlier. Here is how to transcribe the audio:import whispermodel = whisper.load_model("base")result = model.transcribe("yt_audio.mp3")text = result["text"]print(text)This code loads Whisper's base model, transcribes the yt_audio.mp3 file, and extracts the resulting text. The transcribed text is printed to the console, giving you a written version of the video's audio content. With the text ready, you can now proceed to summarize it using Langchain.Summarizing the Transcribed Text with LangchainNow that you have the transcribed text, you can use Langchain to create a summary. Langchain provides a flexible framework for text summarization using OpenAI's language models. This process involves breaking the text into smaller segments and summarizing each one to produce a final, concise overview.Follow these steps to set up the summarization process with Langchain:Import the required modules from Langchain:This includes modules for OpenAI integration, LLM chains, summarization, and text splitting.from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChainfrom langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chainfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitterInitialize the OpenAI language model:llm = OpenAI(model_name="text-davinci-003", openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", temperature=0)Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key, which you can get from the OpenAI platform.Split the transcribed text into manageable chunks:text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0, separators=["", "", ". ", " ", ""])texts = text_splitter.split_text(text)This code divides the text into segments of 1000 characters each, with no overlap. The `separators` parameter ensures the text is split at natural breaks like paragraphs and sentences.4.**Create document objects from the text chunks**:```pythondocs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts]Load the summarization chain:chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce", verbose=False)This code initializes the summarization chain using the map_reduce method. This approach is efficient for large documents because it summarizes each chunk individually (the map step) and then combines those summaries into a final summary (the reduce step).Execute the summarization chain:output_summary = chain.run(docs)print(output_summary)This runs the summarization process on the document chunks and prints the final summary. You now have a concise summary of the original YouTube video's content.By following these steps, you can efficiently summarize YouTube videos using Langchain, OpenAI, and Whisper, automating information extraction and boosting your productivity.Step-by-Step Guide: Summarizing YouTube Videos with CodeStep 1: Open Google Colab and Create a New NotebookOpen your web browser and go to the Google Colab website. Sign in with your Google account. Once logged in, create a new notebook by clicking 'New Notebook'. This opens a clean coding environment for your project.Step 2: Configure Runtime SettingsTo ensure optimal performance, especially for AI models, configure the runtime to use a GPU. Click on 'Runtime' in the menu bar, then select 'Change runtime type'. From the 'Hardware accelerator' dropdown, choose 'GPU'. Save your changes. This allocates a GPU to your session, accelerating the processing tasks.Step 3: Install Required LibrariesNext, install the necessary Python libraries using pip. These include openai, openai-whisper, pytube, and langchain. Run the following code in a Colab cell:!pip install openai!pip install -U openai-whisper!pip install pytube!pip install langchainExecute the cell to install the libraries. Ensure the installations complete successfully before moving on.Step 4: Import Libraries and Set Up OpenAI API KeyImport the necessary libraries into your notebook. Also, set your OpenAI API key to enable access to the language models. You can generate an API key on the OpenAI platform. Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual key in the code.import pytube as ptimport whisperfrom langchain import OpenAI, LLMChainfrom langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chainfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitteropenai_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"Step 5: Load the YouTube Video and Extract AudioSpecify the YouTube video URL and use pytube to extract the audio. The code below creates a YouTube object, filters for audio-only streams, and downloads the audio as an MP3 file:yt = pt.YouTube("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd1kN_myNDs")stream = yt.streams.filter(only_audio=True)[0]stream.download(filename='yt_audio.mp3')Step 6: Transcribe the Audio with WhisperTranscribe the downloaded audio file into text using the Whisper model. Load the model and use it to transcribe the audio:model = whisper.load_model("base")result = model.transcribe("yt_audio.mp3")text = result["text"]print(text)Step 7: Summarize the Text with LangchainSummarize the transcribed text using Langchain. This involves splitting the text into chunks, creating documents from them, and using a summarization chain to generate the final summary.text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0, separators=["", "", ". ", " ", ""])texts = text_splitter.split_text(text)from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoaderfrom langchain.docstore.document import Documentdocs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts]llm = OpenAI(model_name="text-davinci-003", openai_api_key=openai_api_key, temperature=0)chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce", verbose=False)output_summary = chain.run(docs)print(output_summary)This code splits the text, creates documents, initializes the summarization chain, and runs it to produce the summary.Step 8: Run the Code and Obtain the SummaryExecute all the code cells in your Colab notebook. This will run the entire summarization pipeline, from audio download to final summary generation. The resulting summary will be displayed in the console.Pricing Considerations for Langchain, OpenAI, and WhisperUnderstanding the CostsWhen using Langchain, OpenAI, and Whisper, it's important to understand their respective pricing models to manage your budget effectively.OpenAI API: OpenAI charges based on token usage.
